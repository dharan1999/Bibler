# Bibler
Have you ever faced the problem of going to the Library in search of a book and you actually search the entire library but still you can’t find that book you want? 

The reason being simple either the book is not available in the library at that time or you are not sure where to find it exactly making the seeking process very tedious and time-consuming.

Well, Don’t Worry, Bibler to the rescue.

Bibler is a Cross-Platform application based on the React Native platform which renders users navigate the entire library by a click of a button and seek their desired book. 

Bibler tells it’s users whether the book is available in the library or not. It even tells where to find it making it extremely simple and incredibly easy for the users.

In case, if the book is not available in the library at that time, then it even tells when it is going to come.
